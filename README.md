# Final Exam Project of Data Science

## Step 1: Scrapping Data
- Run files .ipynb in folder Scrapping to get 7 raw data files saved in folder Raw_Data
- In folder Demo, there is 1 example file for scrawling data to get 10 samples

## Step 2: Cleanse Data
- Run file data_cleaning.ipynb in folder Data_Cleaning to get 2 clean dataset: big_dataset, small_dataset in folder Dataset

## Step 3: EDA
- In folder EDA, there is 2 files ipynb for big dataset and small dataset 

## Step 4: Preprocessing & Visualization
- Run BigDS_preprocessing_visualization.ipynb in folder Data_Preprocessing_Visualization for Big Dataset
- Run SmallDS_preprocessing_visualization.ipynb in folder Data_Preprocessing_Visualization for Small Dataset
- After running files, we get trainset and testset in folder Training_Testing_Data 

## Step 5: Main
- Run BigDS_main.ipynb for training and testing with Big Dataset
- Run SmallDS_main.ipynb for training and testing with Small Dataset
- Run these 2 files will give results evaluation in folder Results
